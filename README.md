# LargeDisasters
This repository is to investigate ways to predict disasters at the county level. 

# Motivation: 
The motivation for this project is to determine if there are ways to predict disaster outcomes for different groups of people. The Major drivers assisnting in the prediction is the rate of registrations per household. By subdividing the data into smaller units, the variance is more easily accounted for and better predictions are thought to be made. 

# Questions:
This analysis was to investigate three questions. Specifically:
Are Female heads of households, households with people with disabilities, households with elderly people, working individuals or SNAP Recipients good indicators of the number of registrations received by a county in a disaster?
Is there a meaningful way to sub-divide the data to reduce the variance
Is there a relationship between the geographic characteristics of a county and the number of registrations received?

# Files:
ReadMe: This file contains a list of libraries, motivation for the project, a list of files and resources used.

JupyterNotebook: This file contains all of the code related ot findings and results. Within it are connections to the FEMA and Census API and evaluates a series of different paremeters for forecasting the number of registrations

BlogPost: The blog post describes the findings within the Jupyter notebook.

# Findings:
1. The Lasso Coefficients identify S2201_C01_002E as the element most useful to the regression. 
2. The data clusters more closely around the line of best fit when sub-divided into 5 groups. 
3. The area square miles of water did improve the RÂ² value, but was not statistically significant.
